title: VRP and Sweeping - avoiding a missed opportunity in the UK
---

Variable Recurring Payments (VRPs) are a proposed addition to Open
Banking that allow customers to safely connect other services to their
bank account so that those services can make instant payments
automatically on their behalf.

VRPs enable innovation in payments, better control of risk, and the
creation of new types of financial services for customers involving the
intelligent programmatic management of their money.

Sweeping is the automated movement of funds for a customer between accounts in
their name, often to avoid bank charges or benefit from better interest
rates. Sweeping is a goal outlined via the CMA Order of 2016,
intended to create more competition in retail banking.

Analysis and user research has shown that VRPs are the optimal way to deliver
Sweeping as they are extremely safe, give control and flexibility to customers,
and allow services to react quickly where circumstances change.

**If achieved through the Open Banking initiative, a range of sweeping
services would be able to offer personal and business customers
substantial cost savings, revenue optimisations, and overall
improvements to their financial health.**

**It’s because of this public interest that I feel obliged to step forward and
make people aware about my apprehension that the UK may be about to miss out on
this opportunity, unnecessarily.**

Since April 2020, I have worked at the Open Banking Implementation Entity
(OBIE), leading the work on VRP and Sweeping. This has included writing
analysis on risk, technical and regulatory aspects as well as the
formulation of a regulatory structure fit for implementation in the UK.

That work culminated in the publication of two consultation papers in November
2020,  which have been through several phases of industry review. These papers
stood up to scrutiny, and support one central conclusion - Sweeping (a goal
outlined in the CMA Order of 2016) would best be achieved by the CMA9
delivering access through VRP, and that this should be mandated using the
powers of the order.

**In spite of the outputs of the consultation process, efforts are being made
to delay a final conclusion, citing spurious concerns on issues
comprehensively addressed by the papers.**

Any delay would;
1. Push out the opportunity for customers to enjoy the substantial benefits of sweeping services based on VRP,
2. Place delivery at risk given the potential for OBIE to be wound up before sweeping can be implemented.

The OBIE was committed to publishing final recommendations on VRP and Sweeping
(based on the consultation) by the end of March 2021. It appears that this will
now be delayed for a period of months, with no clear rationale for the delay
raised during the consultation itself.

**A delay to VRP and Sweeping is an unnecessary and absolutely avoidable risk.**

The delay is primarily based on non-specific “concerns” about regulatory
treatment and consumer protections. Concerns that are directly addressed in the
consultation papers in ways that were not fundamentally challenged during the
consultation process, yet it is being proposed that OBIE must delay in order to
seek further feedback on the consultation from two parties:

1. Regulators, such as the Financial Conduct Authority.
2. A "Consumer Protection Working Group".

Both of these parties had the opportunity to respond through the proper
channels during the consultation. The consultative process should not be
diluted by time and influences which were not made apparent in representation.
Delay would damage the legitimacy of the process and its output.

**The most likely cause for not finalising a position with these parties
is my exclusion from OBIE’s engagement with them, despite being the
primary author of the framework envisaged in the consultation and
repeatedly raising my absence as a risk. This is denying them the
opportunity to have the details of the papers presented first hand and
to receive direct feedback on concerns or questions on how to proceed.**

I have raised these problems internally and offered up solutions
achievable before the March deadline, without response. My engagement
with OBIE will end in April, and with it my ability to drive a
conclusion to the work I have led for the past year. The net result will
be that the OBIE is left without any direct expertise, but somehow
expecting to develop a conclusion it has failed to reach during the
ample time available leading up to the deadline.

**I am now inviting industry stakeholders to co-sign a guidance document that:**
- conclusively addresses the remaining concerns for the outstanding parties
- provides regulators with a concrete risk-based framework for supervision of PISP activity
- further supports a conclusion to mandate by the end of March

My hope is that, with this, we can collectively ensure the UK achieves the
outcome it deserves in good time, and continues to lead the world in banking
and payments technology.
