title: A call to Open Banking for the timely delivery of VRP for Sweeping in the UK
---
The following is an open letter to Open Banking (OBIE) from industry, for consideration at the steering group meeting on the 25th of March 2021.

### VRP for Sweeping is a significant opportunity for the UK

*   Sweeping is the automated movement of funds for a customer between accounts in their name, often to avoid bank charges or benefit from better interest rates.
*   Sweeping is a roadmap item for Open Banking, required under the CMA Order.
*   Sweeping will bring huge immediate benefits to UK consumers and businesses, contributing to post-Covid economic recovery.
*   Sweeping will increase rates of savings and investment, and reduce rates of debt, overdraft penalties, and other bank charges - creating widespread improvements in overall financial health and resiliency of the UK economy.
*   VRP for Sweeping is the necessary and optimal solution for the UK that has now been fully developed by OBIE and reviewed by industry, with analysis showing it should be mandated under the CMA Order.
*   VRP and Sweeping can be a foundation for the legislative programme outlined by the Payments Landscape Review, and will ensure the UK remains the global leader in payments and regulation in line with recommendations of Kalifa Review.
*   The UK’s independent status helped alleviate concerns around ‘gold plating’ of PSD2 regulation.
*   The [proposed supervisory framework for PSD2 payments](https://stateless.group/2021/03/22/a-supervisory-framework-ensuring-consumer-protections-for-psd2-payments) provides detail on how regulated actors are expected to provide consumer protections.
    *   Risks and controls have been mapped out for regulators and firms.
    *   Framework is derived from the OBIE consultation document which has undergone extensive industry review.
    *   FCA licensing and supervision provide strong underlying assurance on safety for consumers as well as mechanisms for regulatory intervention.
*   Proposed VRP and Sweeping technical standards are complete, and the proposed structure works entirely within the existing legislative model for payments.


### VRP for Sweeping is being unnecessarily put at risk via delays

*   Sweeping has been on the OBIE roadmap since 2017.
*   The deadline for a final recommendation on Sweeping was March 2021.
*   Delaying costs the UK in unrealised benefits, and jeopardises overall delivery due to risks associated with the future of open banking.
*   The consultation on VRP and Sweeping has now provided conclusive evidence on proportionality and consumer protection assurances.
*   OBIE must outline outstanding outputs and commit to a timeline for conclusion.

### Further background on VRP for Sweeping

Sweeping is the automated movement of funds for a customer between accounts in their name, often to avoid bank charges or benefit from better interest rates. Sweeping is a goal outlined via the CMA Order of 2016, intended to create more competition in retail banking. It is an approved, mandated roadmap item OBIE has been tasked to deliver. 

Variable Recurring Payments (VRPs) are a proposed addition to Open Banking that allow customers to safely connect other services to their bank account so that those services can make instant payments automatically on their behalf.

VRPs enable innovation in payments, better control of risk, and the creation of new types of financial services for customers involving the intelligent programmatic management of their money.

Analysis and user research has shown that VRPs are the optimal way to deliver Sweeping as they are extremely safe, give control and flexibility to customers, and allow services to react quickly where circumstances change.

If achieved through the Open Banking initiative, a range of sweeping services would be able to offer personal and business customers substantial cost savings, revenue optimisations, and overall improvements to their financial health.

Sweeping access, by definition, only permits the movement of funds between accounts in the name of the same customer. This eliminates more complex activity such as “consumer payment” use cases (purchasing goods and services) where the risks of dispute are greatly increased. In this respect, Sweeping is an ideal “first step” for UK firms and regulators.

The deadline for the OBIE to deliver a conclusion on Sweeping was March 2021, but it is now facing a proposed delay. Any delay would;



1. Push out the opportunity for customers to enjoy the substantial benefits of sweeping services based on VRP,
2. Place delivery at risk given the potential for OBIE to be wound up before sweeping can be implemented (highlighted by the [CMA’s recent report on future oversight of open banking remedies](https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/future-oversight-of-the-cmas-open-banking-remedies/the-future-oversight-of-the-cmas-open-banking-remedies)).
3. Result in failure to meet the CMA Order as intended, outlined, and prescribed, leading to an incomplete Open Banking initiative. 

OBIE has engaged in extensive analysis and industry consultation which provided conclusive answers to the question of how consumer protection and risks are assured, as well as outlined the clear benefits of VRP for Sweeping. The conclusion of this work is that VRP is the appropriate way to deliver Sweeping in the UK. The technical standards proposed have now been reviewed and supported across industry.

The groundwork is now complete, should be provided as a formal recommendation to The Trustee, and transitioned immediately into the implementation phase via OBIE mandate. 


### The proposed course of action on VRP for Sweeping

We propose that, at March IESG, the following commitments are made for delivery by the subsequent April IESG:

*   OBIE to publish VRP Standard and Sweeping Access Standard.
*   OBIE to deliver final recommendation on mandating Sweeping Access on CMA9.
*   FCA to provide reassurance to market by publishing explicit guidance to firms PISP activity
    *   Based on the proposal document “[A supervisory framework ensuring consumer protections for PSD2 payments in the UK](https://stateless.group/2021/03/22/a-supervisory-framework-ensuring-consumer-protections-for-psd2-payments)” which is derived from OBIE’s VRP Proposition consultation paper.
    *   Delivered by FCA to firms by portfolio communications, and other supervisory correspondence.
    *   To emphasise the obligation on regulated actors to include appropriate consumer protections and risk controls for PISP activity.
    *   Could also be included in an amendment to approach documents.
*   BoE to clarify that Sweeping as a competition remedy presents a competitive risk to the CMA9, not a systemic risk to the UK financial system. Increased competition will make the financial system more robust.
*   Supervisory organisations to begin work with industry in developing frameworks for multilateral contractual access for non-sweeping VRP activity, ensuring that PSR and consumer representatives are involved in the design process.
